# lift_24_netty

The repository contains example projects for using Lift along with Netty. The templates offer a starting point similar to [other ones](https://github.com/lift/lift_24_sbt) provided by the Lift community.

The lift netty project is still being integrated into the lift codebase and for now lives [here](https://github.com/jrwest/lift-and-netty-examples/). These templates, therefore, are not really ready for primetime. In the meantime, if you would like to play with Lift and Netty using these templates, you can checkout this repository and the [lift-netty code](https://github.com/jrwest/lift-and-netty-examples/) into the same directory.

Only Scala 2.9.1 templates currently exist (and should be updated to use 2.9.1-1). 

Scala 2.8.2 templates will be here soon.
